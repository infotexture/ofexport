    - Assertions to prevent mis-wiring of type hierarchies
    - More general config - e.g. global date format?
    - A filter that prepends type to items - for debugging
    - Scan for #xxx in the text and add tp tag?
    - Filter to merge projects folders etc if they have same name?
    - Allow +-3d, 2w etc?
    - Dump OF schema programatically
    - Create a taggable dump of projects as files with links to corresponing Omnifocus entities - for hazel and openmeta scripts
        file format: fld-fld-â€¦-proj
    - Read other file types such as Taskpaper/OPML (done json)
    - Resolve utf8/ascii issues - not sure what's going on - redirecting stdout "changes things" as does invocation from applescript?!?!?!
    - look for OFEXPORT_HOME in the environment first
- Testing
    - test all the assertions properly with unit tests (done most of them)
    - Install it myself separately from my dev environment
    - Update the paths accordingly
- Releasing
    - Save released versions, tag? Make script
